# Tasks

1. First go through of paper -> Get intuition of how the algorithm functions and why the time complexity works out. Determine which parts need more thorough review.
2. Second read through -> Get sufficient clarity on all aspects of paper including algorithm implementation
3. Get feedback before proceeding
4. Implement algorithm
5. Analyse algorithm performance. Identify and correct any errors. Reflect on newly developed understanding.
6. Visualise in some application
