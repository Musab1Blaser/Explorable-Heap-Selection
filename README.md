# Explorable-Heap-Selection

An implementation and application of the algorithm from the IPCO 2023 paper "A Nearly Optimal Randomized Algorithm for Explorable Heap Selection."

The algorithm efficiently finds the nth smallest element in an arbitrary large binary heap with traversal-based access, achieving an expected time complexity of $O(n \log^3 (n))$ using $O(\log n)$ space.
